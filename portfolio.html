    <p style="font-family:arial;">In this project we analyzed a data set to figure out where a rover is.<br>Through our analyzing, we figured out hat the best fit would be the marsh lands. <br> The temperature graph was very smooth and constant, which fits the description accurately. <br> Also, the varying sound graph with high maximums could be explained by the constant critter chirping and buzzing. <br> Finally, the light graph was very constant and went from low to high, representing the planet going from night to day.
